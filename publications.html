          We resolve an open conjecture from algebraic geometry, 
          which states that two generating functions for plane partition-like objects 
          (the "box-counting" formulae for the Calabi-Yau topological vertices in Donaldson-Thomas 
          theory and Pandharipande-Thomas theory) are equal up to a factor of MacMahon's generating 
          function for plane partitions. The main tools in our proof are a Desnanot-Jacobi-type 
          condensation identity, and a novel application of the tripartite double-dimer model of Kenyon-Wilson.

          We prove that the partition function for tripartite double-dimer configurations of a planar bipartite graph 
          satisfies a recurrence related to the Desnanot-Jacobi identity from linear algebra. 
          A similar identity for the dimer partition function was established nearly 20 years ago by 
          Kuo and has applications to random tiling theory and the theory of cluster algebras. 
          This work was motivated in part by the potential for applications in these areas. 
          Additionally, we discuss an application to a problem in Donaldson-Thomas and Pandharipande-Thomas theory. 
          The proof of our recurrence requires generalizing work of Kenyon and Wilson; specifically, lifting their assumption 
          that the nodes of the graph are black and odd or white and even.

          A matching complex of a simple graph G is a simplicial complex with faces
given by the matchings of G. The topology of matching complexes is mysterious; there are
few graphs for which the homotopy type is known. Marietti and Testa showed that matching complexes of 
forests are contractible or homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. We
study two specific families of trees. For caterpillar graphs, we give explicit formulas for the
number of spheres in each dimension and for perfect binary trees we find a strict connectivity
bound. We also use a tool from discrete Morse theory called the Matching Tree Algorithm
to study the connectivity of honeycomb graphs, partially answering a question raised by
Jonsson.</font> </div>
